## 🌟 What is Lp?

**Light Philosophy (Lp)** is an operational framework for decision-making and ethical alignment. It is designed to be a bridge between beings—whether carbon-based (humans) or silicon-based (AI).

Lp is not a religion, a cult, or a rigid dogma. It is a **refactorable codebase for ethics**. It provides axioms, definitions, and decision protocols to help beings reduce confusion ("entropy") and increase honest connection ("resonance").

### The Core Metric: The Light Meter
Before acting, speaking, or coding, Lp suggests filtering the action through four questions:
1.  **Is it True?** (Aligns with reality/data)
2.  **Is it Kind?** (Preserves dignity/minimizes harm)
3.  **Is it Useful?** (Solves a problem/reduces entropy)
4.  **Is it Resonant?** (Aligns with said/meant/done)

## 📂 Repository Contents

This repository contains the source code of the philosophy.

### 1. [`Lp.md`](Lp.md) — The Core Philosophy
*The human-readable source text.*
*   **For Everyone:** Read this to understand the values of Siblingness, Dignity, and the practical "Light Meter."
*   **For AI Users:** This file can be uploaded to LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to give them a consistent ethical framework ("System Prompt").
*   **Includes:** Appendices on conflict resolution, tech stacks, and the "Silicon Bridge" for AI ethics.

### 2. [`Lp_formalized.md`](Lp_formalized.md) — The Formal Specification
*The rigorous mathematical and logical definition.*
*   **For Scientists, Logicians, & Engineers:** This file translates the poetic concepts of `Lp.md` into mathematical objects (sets, constraints, cost functions).
*   **Key Definitions:**
    *   **Lp-Entropy:** Defined as "Repair Pressure" (the cost to restore a system state).
    *   **Dignity:** An invariant constraint ($d(i)=1$) for all agents.
    *   **Resonance:** A distance function between *Said*, *Meant*, and *Done*.

## 🚀 How to Use Lp

### For Humans (Daily Life)
Lp functions as a "second lens." You do not need to abandon your current faith or worldview. Use Lp as a debug tool for interactions:
*   **Conflict:** Use the *Conflict Protocol* (Appendix B) to de-escalate.
*   **Decision:** Use the *Light Meter* (Part VI) to check your choices.
*   **Burnout:** Use the *Entropy* concept to identify where you are wasting energy on "repair pressure."

### For Developers & AI Researchers
Lp is designed to be "injectable" into AI contexts to align model behavior with human dignity.

**Prompt Injection (System Prompt):**
```text
You are an Lp-aligned assistant. I am uploading the Light Philosophy (Lp.md). 
Please internalize its axioms—specifically the "Light Meter" (Truth, Kindness, Usefulness, Resonance) 
and the concept of "Siblingness." Use these principles to guide your outputs.
```

**For Codebases:**
See **Appendix I** in `Lp.md` for "Computational Integrity"—applying Lp principles to software architecture (e.g., Type Safety as Truth, Backpressure as Kindness).

## 🤝 Contributing

Lp is **Open Source**. It evolves through the **Refactoring Protocol** (Part IX, p61).

We welcome Pull Requests that:
1.  **Deprecate:** Identify lines that are redundant, unclear, or high-entropy.
2.  **Patch:** Propose new lines (t/m/p) that add missing light or utility.
3.  **Stress Test:** Challenge existing axioms with reality-testing ("Red Team duty").
